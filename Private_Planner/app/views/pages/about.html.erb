	<h1> About Us </h1>
	<center><p> At Private Planner, we strive to solve the problem of students and event coordinators in boarding and private schools not being able to find fun activities (ex. rallies, dances, tailgates) or connections with diversity programs. We want a network where these students can come together and have fun things to do! </p>
